## Database State Comparison

### ❌ BEFORE

```sql
-- RLS Status
ALTER TABLE cars: RLS = ENABLED (or DISABLED)

-- Policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'cars';
-- Result: 0 rows (No policies!)

-- Permissions
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_name = 'cars';
-- Result: Limited or no permissions for authenticated users

-- What happens when user tries to INSERT:
INSERT INTO cars (...) VALUES (...);
-- Error: permission denied for table cars
-- OR
-- Error: new row violates row-level security policy
```

### ✅ AFTER

```sql
-- RLS Status
ALTER TABLE cars: RLS = ENABLED (with proper policies)

-- Policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'cars';
-- Result: 4 rows
-- 1. "Anyone can view cars" (SELECT)
-- 2. "Authenticated users can insert cars" (INSERT)
-- 3. "Authenticated users can update cars" (UPDATE)
-- 4. "Authenticated users can delete cars" (DELETE)

-- Permissions
SELECT grantee, privilege_type 
FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_name = 'cars';
-- Result:
-- authenticated: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
-- anon: SELECT

-- What happens when user tries to INSERT:
INSERT INTO cars (...) VALUES (...);
-- Success: Returns new row with generated ID
```

## Security Comparison

### ❌ BEFORE

```
Security State: Inconsistent
- RLS might be enabled but no policies
- Or RLS disabled entirely
- Unpredictable behavior
- Potential security holes

Access Control:
❌ No one can modify (too restrictive)
OR
❌ Everyone can modify (too permissive)

Result: Either broken or insecure
```

### ✅ AFTER

```
Security State: Properly Configured
- RLS enabled ✅
- Policies in place ✅
- Predictable behavior ✅
- Security enforced at database level ✅

Access Control:
✅ Public: Read-only (SELECT)
✅ Authenticated: Full CRUD (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
✅ Anonymous: Read-only (SELECT)

Result: Secure AND functional ✅
```
