# 🎯 Quick Reference Card - Admin CRUD

## 🚨 Emergency Fix (1 Minute)

```sql
-- Copy this entire block into Supabase SQL Editor and run it:

ALTER TABLE public.cars DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE public.cars ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view cars" ON public.cars FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert cars" ON public.cars FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update cars" ON public.cars FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete cars" ON public.cars FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (true);

GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON public.cars TO authenticated;
GRANT SELECT ON public.cars TO anon;
```

**Done! Test it now.**

## 🔍 Quick Diagnostics

### Check if RLS is enabled:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE tablename = 'cars';
-- Should show: rowsecurity = true
```

### Check if policies exist:
```sql
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'cars';
-- Should show 4 policies
```

### Check permissions:
```sql
SELECT grantee, privilege_type FROM information_schema.role_table_grants 
WHERE table_name = 'cars' ORDER BY grantee;
-- authenticated: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
-- anon: SELECT
```

## 🛠️ Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Error: Failed to insert" | Run `fix_cars_permissions.sql` |
| "Error: Failed to update" | Check if you're logged in as admin |
| "Error: Failed to delete" | Verify RLS policies with SQL above |
| No cars showing | Check if RLS is blocking SELECT |
| Changes don't persist | Check browser console for errors |
| Debug panel shows error | Copy error to read detailed message |
