Face recognition admin login doesn't create a Supabase auth session, so file uploads fail with "permission denied."

## ✅ **Working Solution: Use URLs Instead**

Since you're not authenticated with Supabase, use this method:

## 📸 **Step-by-Step Guide:**

### **Step 1: Upload Images to Supabase Storage**

1. **Open new browser tab**
2. **Go to:** `https://supabase.com/dashboard`
3. **Login to Supabase** (your Supabase account)
4. **Select your project:** MotorenKlaro
5. **Click Storage** (left sidebar)
6. **Click `lovable-uploads` bucket**
7. **Click "Upload"** button
8. **Select all your BMW images:**
   - `BMW_X7_Main.png` (or your main/best image)
   - `BMW_X7_Side.png`
   - `BMW_X7_Front.png`
   - `BMW_X7_Rear.png`
9. **Click Upload**

### **Step 2: Copy Image URLs**

After upload, for each image:
1. **Click the image** in the file list
2. **Click "Copy URL"** button (top right)
3. **Paste in a notepad** - you'll need all 4 URLs

You'll get URLs like:
```
https://mysmemebqzhdxpxabugk.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/lovable-uploads/BMW_X7_Main.png
https://mysmemebqzhdxpxabugk.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/lovable-uploads/BMW_X7_Side.png
https://mysmemebqzhdxpxabugk.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/lovable-uploads/BMW_X7_Front.png
https://mysmemebqzhdxpxabugk.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/lovable-uploads/BMW_X7_Rear.png
```

### **Step 3: Add URLs in Admin Panel**

1. **Go back to:** `http://localhost:8087/admin`
2. **Click "Manage Cars"**
3. **Edit BMW X7** (or whichever car)
4. **Scroll to "Car Images"**
5. **Click "Use URLs Instead"** button (top right of image section)
6. **Paste the 4 URLs:**
   - Image 1 (Main/Thumbnail): Paste first URL
   - Image 2 (Side View): Paste second URL
   - Image 3 (Front View): Paste third URL
   - Image 4 (Rear/Back View): Paste fourth URL
7. **Click "Update Car"**
8. ✅ **Done!**

## 🎯 **Result:**

- ✅ Images saved to car
- ✅ Main image shows on car listing cards
- ✅ All 4 images show in carousel on details page
- ✅ No permission errors!

## 📝 **For All Your Cars:**

Repeat this process for each car/brand:
1. Upload 4 images to Supabase Storage
2. Copy the 4 URLs
3. Edit car in admin
4. Click "Use URLs Instead"
5. Paste URLs
6. Save

## 💡 **Future Fix:**

To enable direct uploads from admin panel, we need to create a proper admin user in Supabase that gets authenticated. But for now, **the URL method works perfectly!**
